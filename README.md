# JavaScript - Generating a random password

## What, why, and how??
I created this application because my end user needs a secure password because they deal with sensitive information.  Their password has certain requirements that must be met, so I came up with a simple way to generate a new password whenver necessary.  This application is very easy to use, and the end user has complete control over how strong they want the password to be.  The end user decides the length of the password, as well as whether or not they want to include numbers, special characters, as well as lower case or upper case letters.

I learned that there are a lot of different ways to solve a problem when coding, and my project stands out because of how concise I was able to make the program.  Please check out the application below!

## Collaborators
Brian Lee, my tutor, helped me out a lot.  I had most of the code written when I met with him, but he really helped me clean it up so it was more concise and easier to read.
